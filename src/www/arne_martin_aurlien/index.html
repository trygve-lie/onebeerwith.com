            <h1>Arne Martin Aurlien</h1>
            <p>My name is Arne Martin Aurlien, I'm a web developer/javascript hacker currently employed by <a href="http://boostcom.no/">Boost Communications</a> in Trondheim, Norway. I work with the mobile web all day every day, and do both front-end and back-end development. I'm passionate about emerging web technologies, and try to do my best to share that passion (as well as my passion for great beer) with the others at my workplace.</p>
            <h2>What got you interested in good beer?</h2>
            <p>I've always enjoyed the finer things in life, but I didn't start drinking good beer (or much beer at all, really) before I moved to Trondheim to study. When I got here people started taking me to <a href="http://www.dengodenabo.com/">Den Gode Nabo</a> ("The Good Neighbor"), the best beer pub in town and arguably one of the best in Norway, and I soon started drinking English, Belgian and American ales. Being a geek and something of a completionist I always want to try something new, and by now I believe I must have tried at least 400-500 different beers from all around the world. I should really start taking notes at some point.</p>
            <h2>What makes a good beer?</h2>
            <p>To me a good beer is all about the craft. Making a good beer takes experience, perseverance, creativity and a great deal of control over both the ingredients and the process, and all these factors certainly affect the end product. Beer brewed without excitement, enthusiasm and passion is rarely worth drinking.</p>
            <p>Beer is a remarkably versatile drink, and can be consumed in a great variety of settings and situations, but the common thread in most of these is the social angle, whether it's a pint at the pub, a choice pairing at a fancy dinner, or a glass while watching a movie with friends. Good beer gets even better with good company, and great beers are made to be shared.</p>
            <p>A few years ago simply drinking beer stopped being satisfactory for my inner (and outer) geek, so I started brewing myself (along with a friend). After a few somewhat drinkable attempts this quickly escalated, and after we got real serious last august we have spent an excessive amount of money on our brewery, kegs and ingredients. However, I cannot help but think the heavy investments have been completely worth it, since <a href="http://www.frostingen.no/nyhet.cfm?nyhetid=1287">we managed to win the Norwegian christmas beer competition</a> last year (with a heavily spiced wit-bock). Now we are brewing almost every weekend, and our beer just keeps improving. We have tried our hand at most styles, most heavily geared towards English and American ales.</p>
            <p>For us the brewing, and not just the drinking, is a social thing, and the apartment is usually full of friends who spend the day helping out with the brewing, making dinner, or just hanging around drinking our beer while playing games and listening to music.</p>
            <h2>What is your favorite beers?</h2>
            <p>I enjoy all types of beer -- light and dark lagers, wheat beers, english bitters and pale ales, mild and brown ales, porters and stouts, IPAs, belgian ales of all types, sour beers, fruit beers, smoked beers, barley wines and all kinds of extreme beers. The only thing I won't drink is cheap mass-produced yellow fizz, commonly called "pilsener" in a cruel mockery of the original classic. "It depends" is a boring answer, but when it comes to beer, for me it truly does -- I have favorites in almost all categories, and what I will choose to drink is highly dependent upon the situation.</p>
            <p>After I started brewing, my taste buds have become more adept at picking up defects and weaknesses as well as desirable flavors, and as a result I have become much more aware (and perhaps critical) of what I drink. This can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to simply enjoying a beer, but all in all it feels great to become more knowledgeable about what I'm doing.</p>
            <h2>Where do you get hold of your favorites?</h2>
            <p>Buying beer in Norway is a somewhat sad affair, since anything above 4,75% vol. has to be purchased at government-owned retailers. Thankfully the selection of beers both above and below this limit has been getting a lot better over the past few years, and after the import ban was lifted a couple of years ago, the selection at dedicated beer pubs has expanded drastically as well. My favorite pub in Trondheim is Den Gode Nabo (as previously mentioned), and they commonly have around 20 beers on tap, as well as around 200 bottled beers. Quality beer is relatively expensive in Norway, but I find it a cheap luxury compared to many other things.</p>
            <p>When I am traveling abroad, I always try to scope out the beer selection and the local beer shops, brewpubs and other hangouts before going. This has helped me discover many gems across Europe, and I almost always return with a bag full of bottles.</p>
