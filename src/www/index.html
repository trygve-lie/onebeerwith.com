                <p>Software development and brewing have several aspects in common. Both are true craftsmanships, it takes skills, precision, experience, the people behind are passionate and dedicated to their profession and they strive for higher quality.</p>
                <p>Programming come in many flavours and so does beer. Here at One Beer With we take programmers out of their usual context and talk about a second passion we have found in many of them; a passion for fine beer.</p>
                <p>Cheers!</p>
