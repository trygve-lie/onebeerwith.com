            <h1>Mark Boas</h1>
            <p>My name is Mark Boas - I'm a web developer, enthusiastic for new and open web technologies. I work for a small company called <a href="http://www.happyworm.com/" title="Happyworm Ltd. homepage">Happyworm Ltd,</a> we are 2.5 people in total - two developers and one very tiny designer. We love most forms of audio and created <a href="http://www.jplayer.org/" title="jPlayer homepage - A jQuery HTML5 audio and video library">jPlayer</a> the audio/video JS lib. I live in a town called San Casciano In Val Di Pesa in the heart of wine growing country just outside Florence. My co-developer is Edinburgh based - a city of many a great beer and my home previous to this for around 10 years.</p>
            <h2>What got you interested in good beer?</h2>
            <p>Growing up in the north of England and spending many years in Edinburgh I have always appreciated good beer. My mother used to drink sweetheart stout (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/53/12573) when she was pregnant with me, so I got off to a good start. Also the fact that my grandfather was a publican may have something to do with it. It feels like I have always drunk beer, I started very young drinking a mix of lemonade and beer at places such as rugby clubs, where they used to encourage that sort of thing. As far as good beers are concerned I have always preferred bitter to lager, I discovered some great real ales in Middlesbrough when I was a student there, a pub called the Tap and Barrel.</p>
            <h2>What makes a good beer and how passionate are you?</h2>
            <p>Good beer to me should firstly contain as little additives and preservatives as possible and no added gas! So I like my beer natural. This may account for the old addage "If the bottom has fallen out of your world, drink real ale and the world will fall out of your bottom!". To me most real ales actually taste a bit weird on the first sup, but you acquire the taste as you go along, drinkability is important and I think a telling sign is that a decent beer still tastes good relatively warm. It's of no surprise to me that both lager and coca-cola need to be chilled to be in any way drinkable.</p>
            <h2>What is your favorite beers?</h2>
            <p>I love pale ale, especially beers of around 3.5% ABV, nice and light, easy to drink in quantity (sometimes). I used to love the Deuchars IPA they did in Cloisters (Edinburgh) - I would never get sick of that stuff, but they had some other nice IPAs - Green King among them. I love the hoppy influence.</p>
            <p>There is actually a good micro-brew scene here in this part of Italy - I have tasted some fine beers. I'm actually a member of http://www.pintamedicea.com/ and I'm attempting to brew my own. Locally, it's worth nipping to La Birroteca of Greve and I sometimes sneak off on my Vespa of a Saturday for sly pint. The last beer I drank there was a very dark coloured IPA. Locally brewed.</p>
            <h2>Where do you get hold of your favorites?</h2>
            <p>I am proud to be part of our local Casa Del Popolo (house of the people) - a type of community centre, where I do voluntary work in the pizzeria bar. The sell a selection of good bottled beers that I help choose, I think they have some type of IPA from California, unfortunately they are a bit pricey so I tend to stick to whisky which is more reasonably priced. When I'm in Florence I mostly drink Murphy's Stout at The Joshua Tree, usually during happy hour, although there is a micro brewery I'm itching to try out as a venue for beer.js Firenze - it's called Il Bovaro http://www.ilbovaro.it/ they also do great chips!</p>
